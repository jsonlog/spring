This guide walks you through the process of using https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-neo4j/[Spring Data Neo4j] to build an application that stores data in and retrieves it from https://www.neo4j.com/[Neo4j], a graph-based database.


== What you'll build

You'll use Neo4j's link:/understanding/NoSQL[NoSQL] graph-based data store to build an embedded Neo4j server, store entities and relationships, and develop queries.

== What you'll need

== Standing up a Neo4j server

Before you can build a this application, you need to set up a Neo4j server.

Neo4j has an open source server you can install for free:

On a Mac, just type:

----
$ brew install neo4j
----

For other options, visit https://neo4j.com/download/community-edition/

Once you installed, launch it with it's default settings:

----
$ neo4j start
----

You should see a message like this:

....
Starting Neo4j.
Started neo4j (pid 96416). By default, it is available at http://localhost:7474/
There may be a short delay until the server is ready.
See /usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.0.6/libexec/logs/neo4j.log for current status.
....

By default, Neo4j has a username/password of neo4j/neo4j. However, it requires that the new account password be changed. To do so, execute the following command:

----
$ curl -v -u neo4j:neo4j -X POST localhost:7474/user/neo4j/password -H "Content-type:application/json" -d "{\"password\":\"secret\"}"
----

This changes the password from *neo4j* to *secret* (something to NOT DO in production!) With that completed, you should be ready to run this guide.

== Define a simple entity
Neo4j captures entities and their relationships, with both aspects being of equal importance. Imagine you are modeling a system where you store a record for each person. But you also want to track a person's co-workers (`teammates` in this example). With Neo4j, you can capture all that with some simple annotations.

`src/main/java/hello/Person.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Person.java[]
----

Here you have a `Person` class that has only one attribute, the `name`.

NOTE: In this guide, the typical getters and setters are omitted for brevity.

The `Person` class is annotated `@NodeEntity`. When Neo4j stores it, it results in the creation of a new node. This class also has an `id` marked `@GraphId`. Neo4j uses `@GraphId` internally to track the data.

The next important piece is the set of `teammates`. It is a simple `Set<Person>`, but marked up as `@Relationship`. This means that every member of this set is expected to also exist as a separate `Person` node. Note how the direction is set to `UNDIRECTED`. This means that when you query the `TEAMMATE` relationship, Spring Data Neo4j will ignore the direction of the relationship.

With the `worksWith()` method, you can easily link people together.

Finally, you have a convenient `toString()` method to print out the person's name and that person's co-workers.

== Create simple queries
Spring Data Neo4j is focused on storing data in Neo4j. But it inherits functionality from the Spring Data Commons project, including the ability to derive queries. Essentially, you don't have to learn the query language of Neo4j, but can simply write a handful of methods and the queries are written for you.

To see how this works, create an interface that queries `Person` nodes.

`src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java[]
----

`PersonRepository` extends the `GraphRepository` interface and plugs in the type it operates on: `Person`. Out-of-the-box, this interface comes with many operations, including standard CRUD (create-read-update-delete) operations.

But you can define other queries as needed by simply declaring their method signature. In this case, you added `findByName`, which seeks nodes of type `Person` and finds the one that matches on `name`. You also have `findByTeammatesName`, which looks for a `Person` node, drills into each entry of the `teammates` field, and matches based on the teammate's `name`.

== Permissions to access Neo4j

Neo4j Community Edition requires credentials to access it. This can be configured with a couple properties.

[source]
----
include::complete/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

This includes the default username `neo4j` and the newly set password `secret` we picked earlier.

WARNING: Do NOT store real credentials in your source repository. Instead, configure them in your runtime using https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config[Spring Boot's property overrides].

With this in place, let's wire this up and see what it looks like!

== Create an Application class
Here you create an Application class with all the components.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/spring-boot-application.adoc[]

Spring Boot will handle those repositories automatically as long as they are included
in the same package (or a sub-package) of your `@SpringBootApplication` class. For more control over the
registration process, you can use the `@EnableNeo4jRepositories` annotation.

NOTE: By default, `@EnableNeo4jRepositories` will scan the current package for any interfaces that extend one of Spring Data's repository interfaces. Use it's `basePackageClasses=MyRepository.class` to safely tell Spring Data Neo4j to scan a different root package by type if your project layout has multiple projects and its not finding your repositories.

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.

You autowire an instance of `PersonRepository` that you defined earlier. Spring Data Neo4j will dynamically implement that interface and will plug in the needed query code to meet the interface's obligations.

The `public static void main` uses Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` to launch the application and invoke the `CommandLineRunner` that builds the relationships.

In this case, you create three local `Person` s, **Greg**, **Roy**, and **Craig**. Initially, they only exist in memory. It's also important to note that no one is a teammate of anyone (yet).

At first, you find Greg and indicate that he works with Roy and Craig, then persist him again. Remember, the teammate relationship was marked as `UNDIRECTED`, that is, bidirectional. That means that Roy and Craig will have been updated as well.

That's why when you need to update Roy, it's critical that you fetch that record from Neo4j first. You need the latest status on Roy's teammates before adding **Craig** to the list.

Why is there no code that fetches Craig and adds any relationships? Because you already have! **Greg** earlier tagged Craig as a teammate, and so did Roy. That means there is no need to update Craig's relationships again. You can see it as you iterate over each team member and print their information to the console.

Finally, check out that other query where you look backwards, answering the question "who works with whom?"


include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_mainhead.adoc[]
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


You should see something like this (with other stuff like queries as well):
....
Before linking up with Neo4j...
	Greg's teammates => []
	Roy's teammates => []
	Craig's teammates => []

Lookup each person by name...
	Greg's teammates => [Roy, Craig]
	Roy's teammates => [Greg, Craig]
	Craig's teammates => [Roy, Greg]
....

You can see from the output that initially no one is connected by any relationship. Then after adding people in, they are tied together. Finally, you can see the handy query that looks up people based on teammate.

== Summary
Congratulations! You just set up an embedded Neo4j server, stored some simple, related entities, and developed some quick queries.

NOTE: If you're interesting in exposing Neo4j repositories with a hypermedia-based RESTful front end with little effort, you might want to read link:/guides/gs/accessing-neo4j-data-rest[Accessing Neo4j Data with REST].
